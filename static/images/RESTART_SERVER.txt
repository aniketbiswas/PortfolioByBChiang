After you've added the pixel-duck.gif file to this directory, restart the 
development server with these commands:

1. Stop any running Gatsby server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Run: 
   cd /Users/aniketbiswas/Personal\ Projects/PortfolioByBChiang
   npm run develop

If you encounter any "Bad CPU type in executable" errors, try using nvm to switch to 
an ARM-compatible Node.js version:
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   npm run develop
